          <h2>The downconverters (again)</h2>
          <p>After experimenting and a <em>lot</em> of thought processing, my dad finally decided to take a crack at modifying the downconverters.</p>
          <p>We determined that the green-labelled pot from the board was the local ocillator (LO) adjustment.</p>
          <p>Problem is, we didn't have a signal generator.</p>
          <h2>The signal generator</h2>
          <p>I figured out how to conjure up a 1253.25 MHz signal generator using a Raspberry Pi 3 (B+) running <a href="https://github.com/F5OEO/rpitx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rpitx</a>. </p>
          <p>I hooked up two leads from the Pi, one from GPIO 4 to the antenna and the other from a related GPIO pin to ground (I forget which one).</p>
          <p>Using SSH, I ran the following command to install rpitx:</p>
          <code>
            git clone https://github.com/F5OEO/rpitx
            <br>
            cd rpitx
            <br>
            ./install.sh
            <br>
            sudo reboot
            <br>
            ...
            <br>
            cd rpitx
            <br>
            ./easytest.sh
          </code>
          <p>From there, I set the output frequency to <code>1253.25</code> MHz and selected the <code>Tune</code> option which outputs a carrier signal.</p>
          <h2>The frequency counter</h2>
          <p>Reading more into the TVC-12G, I found out that a math equation is used to adjust the local ocillator (LO) frequency.</p>
          <p>When we first hooked up the downconverter to a frequency counter (well, actually an ICOM receiver), we found that the LO frequency was 1240 MHz.</p>
          <p>We then used the math equation to determine the LO frequency:</p>
          <code>LO = F - 181.25 MHz (Channel 8)</code>
          <p>The <code>F</code> is the target input frequency, which for us was 1253.25 MHz.</p>
          <p>Therefore, the LO frequency should be 1072 MHz and not 1240 MHz.</p>
          <p>Having hooked up one of the downconverters to the signal generator, we adjusted the LO frequency to 1072 MHz and found that the output frequency was around 181.25 MHz.</p>
          <h2>The suspense</h2>
          <p>Knowing that the old CRT TV could track channels without it being exactly accurate, we hooked up the downconverter to the TV and tuned to channel 8.</p>
          <p>We didn't get a picture as nobody was using the repeater, but we did believe it was correct at least.</p>
          <p>However, when we tuned to channel 50 (not 49 or 51), we got a completely black screen with static audio.</p>
          <p>The audio carrier is usually 5 MHz off anyways, so it's not a big deal.</p>
          <p>But picking up something on channel 50 sounds really weird.</p>
          <h2>The coil</h2>
          <p>Before messing with the LO, my dad contacted the <a href="https://www.hamtv.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ham TV</a> guy and he mentioned that there is a missing coil on the downconverter. </p>
          <p>I can't share photos of the manual here, but on the board it was replaced with a straight wire for some reason.</p>
          <p>
            <a href="/img/posts/hamradio/fstv-chronicles/PXL_20221127_013031250.jpg" title="Missing coil"><img src="/img/posts/hamradio/fstv-chronicles/PXL_20221127_013031250.jpg" alt="Missing coil"></a>
          </p>
          <p>We believe that this missing coil is related to the channel 7/8 output, and that's why we might be getting a picture on channel 50.</p>
          <p>It'd take some trial and error to figure out if this is the case, but we'll figure it out.</p>
          <h2>The future</h2>
          <p>We're expecting the transmitter to arrive between Dec. 3rd and Dec. 5th.</p>
          <p>Alongside the transmitter, my dad ordered an HDMI to composite video adapter.</p>
          <p>
            <a href="/img/posts/hamradio/fstv-chronicles/hdmi-to-composite.jpg" title="HDMI to composite video adapter"><img src="/img/posts/hamradio/fstv-chronicles/hdmi-to-composite.jpg" alt="HDMI to composite video adapter"></a>
          </p>
          <p>We're going to try to use <a href="https://obsproject.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OBS Studio</a> to project onto the transmitter as if it was another monitor.</p>
          <p>I'm not sure if it'll work, but we'll see.</p>
