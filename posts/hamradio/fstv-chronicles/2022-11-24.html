          <h2>The progress</h2>
          <p>Two days ago, my dad talked with the <a href="https://www.atn-tv.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ATN-TV</a> guys through their Whereby net/roundtable.</p>
          <p>They were very helpful and gave him some tips on the equipment and how to set it up, alongside confirming that the repeater on Mount Potosi is still active.</p>
          <p>They also talked about the repeater's input and output frequencies. Turns out, the repeater might have a different output frequency than what's listed on the website.</p>
          <p>But at the very least, it's less complicated than we first thought.</p>
          <h2>The downconverters</h2>
          <p>During the meeting, my dad shared a picture of two downconverters that we bought from eBay that hadn't yet arrived.</p>
          <p>They were impressed that we managed to find them, given that they were "antiques" and supposedly working.</p>
          <p>They're TVC-12G models and were made by P.C. Electronics in 1989.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, yesterday when we had received them, they didn't work.</p>
          <p>
            <a href="/img/posts/hamradio/fstv-chronicles/PXL_20221124_020853760.jpg" title="Photo of one of the downconverters"><img src="/img/posts/hamradio/fstv-chronicles/PXL_20221124_020853760.jpg" alt="Photo of one of the downconverters"></a>
          </p>
          <p>Here is what one of them looks like. Our specific models are <em>made</em> to downconvert 1.2 GHz, but they were modified to take an input of 1.8-2.0 GHz. </p>
          <p>The downconverters are powered by 12V DC, and they have a 100 Ohm antenna input and a 75 Ohm TV output. One of them has a BNC connector for power(?) and the other has a 3.5mm jack. (the kind you'd find on a headphone jack)</p>
          <p>We found out that they were modified by the previous owner before my dad bought them, given that they had a label with input and output frequencies that were out of range.</p>
          <p>Though I believe that it's possible to re-modify at least one of them to work with the repeater's input frequencies once again. So, we took them apart.</p>
          <p>
            <a href="/img/posts/hamradio/fstv-chronicles/PXL_20221124_005938437~2.jpg" title="Photo of the inside of one the downconverters"><img src="/img/posts/hamradio/fstv-chronicles/PXL_20221124_005938437~2.jpg" alt="Photo of the inside of one the downconverters"></a>
          </p>
          <p>This specific photo shows the inside of the downconverter with a BNC connector for power. The other one has a 3.5mm jack, but are otherwise identical aside from a few potentiometer values.</p>
          <p>I labelled the potentiometers with colors and marked down some of their values:</p>
          <p>
            <a href="/img/posts/hamradio/fstv-chronicles/PXL_20221124_182851349.jpg" title="Photo of a notepad with the potentiometer values"><img src="/img/posts/hamradio/fstv-chronicles/PXL_20221124_182851349.jpg" alt="Photo of a notepad with the potentiometer values"></a>
          </p>
          <p>The potentiometers are labeled as follows:</p>
          <code>
            TVC12G W/BNC 12V DC:
            <br>
            Red: 98.9 Ω
            <br>
            Yellow: 0.2 Ω
            <br>
            Blue: 97.6 Ω
            <br>
            Green: 10.06 KΩ (468.3 Ω on other point)
            <br>
            Purple: 0.2 Ω
            <br>
            TVC12G W/3.5mm 12V DC:
            <br>
            Red: 106.6 Ω
            <br>
            Yellow: N/A (didn't check)
            <br>
            Blue: 99.2 Ω
            <br>
            Green: 10.06 KΩ (471.98 Ω on other point)
            <br>
            Purple: N/A (didn't check)
          </code>
          <h2>The hookups</h2>
          <p>My dad hooked up each downconverter to their appropriate power source, antenna, and of course the CRT TV from before.</p>
          <p>We were looking to see if the downconverters worked at all, but we couldn't find a signal on the TV, although it did flash a few times and caused some interference on channels 53 and 54.</p>
          <p>The correct channel output frequency should be channel 7 or 8 (175.25 or 181.25 MHz video carrier), but we couldn't find anything.</p>
          <p>After learning that channels 53 and 54 seemed to be affected by the downconverters, we hooked up the downconverters to an ICOM reciever (of which I don't know the model number) to view the output frequencies.</p>
          <p>Turns out that a lot of frequencies were affected, we even managed to find airplane signals on lower frequencies, proving that it <em>is</em> downconverting. </p>
          <p>We couldn't find the manual online, by the looks of it only <a href="https://hamtv.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HAM TV</a> only provides them and you need to be a licensed amateur radio operator to get one. </p>
          <p>Therefore, I personally can't email them, but my dad can. I'll make a new page with regards to that when possible.</p>
          <h2>The current state</h2>
          <p>We're still trying to figure out how to get the downconverters to work, but we're not giving up.</p>
          <p>Two days from now, we'd receive a handheld TV scanner that we ordered from eBay, so we'll see if that works.</p>
          <p>Come December, we'll have a transmitter to get to Mount Potosi and try to get the repeater to work.</p>
          <p>More progress will be shared over time, thank you for reading.</p>
